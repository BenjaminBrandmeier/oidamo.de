          <p>My name is Benjamin Brandmeier. I was born in 1988, I'm a father of two and located nearby Munich, Germany.</p>
          <p>I'm a passionate software developer. I'm interested in multiple stuff like frontend and backend development, DevOps, agile software development, Continuous Deployment and much more. Languages I like are Python, Typescript, Javascript, Java and Bavarian. But be aware of the last one, it takes a lifetime to master.</p>
          <p>In this blog I'm trying to blog about open-source projects I'm currently working on and everything else that I assume to be shareworthy.</p>
          <p>Developing for open source projects is very time consuming, however I want to give something back to the community, because there is plenty of stuff I benefit from everyday.</p>
